        <b>NODE</b>
        <p>
            NODE is a network that makes art work.
        </p>    
        <p>
            We collaborate, conspire, and push boundaries to help artists create unforgettable experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re dreamers and misfits who don’t care much about the rules (even the ones we invent). We reject the midcurve – the safe, the obvious, the boring.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe that art is not separate from technology – it’s the force that makes it matter. We embrace this contradiction and welcome anyone who doesn’t quite fit in to join us. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The future is a network. The future is ours.
